Different NLP techniques have been applied to different datasets for sentiment analysis of movies reviews, online product reviews, etc. These techniques have shown different levels of accuracy on different datasets. Using different datasets, however, makes it difficult to juxtapose these techniques. This presents a need to compare these techniques on the same dataset to better identify which technique is better for the sentiment analysis of movies reviews.
##### In this study, we will compare five NLP techniques for sentiment analysis:
1. XLEN
2. GraphStar
3. BlackSparse
4. Bert Large
5. Modified LMU
